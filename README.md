## Resources
I had debated about using the alt tag for some of the images, as they did not seem to fit.   I opted for the Alt null for the Aside, as I did not feel the images enhanced the page and were more decor.

I found this information interesting, since the image was on the CSS page and not on the HTML page.  Moving the image information could impact the page layout.
